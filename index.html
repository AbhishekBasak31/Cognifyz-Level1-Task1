        He'd tallied 75 runs in seven games, including two ducks. India won every game but Kohli was reduced to a
        concerning afterthought, saved by the middle order and bowlers.
    <br>
        The humbling scores followed a spectacular Indian Premier League for Kohli, who set or extended tournament
        records in scoring 741 runs at an average of nearly 62.
<br>
        Captain and fellow opener Rohit Sharma, despite their low-scoring partnerships at the World Cup, insisted
        throughout that he and Kohli were the first names on the team list.
<br>
        His faith was repaid in the final against South Africa on Saturday, when Kohli led Indiaâ€™s batting with 76 from
        59 balls in a competitive total of 176-7. The bowlers brilliantly defended the total to win a thriller by seven
        runs and make India a world champion for the first time in 13 years.
